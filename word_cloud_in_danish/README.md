# Word Cloud In Danish
In this project you can see one of the ways to analyse customers comments - word cloud. 

## Aim
The aim of the project is to analyse customers feedback on services at one glance. 

## Data
In this project as dummy data I used danish poem by H.С.Andersen "I Danmark er jeg født", because nobody should show customers data.
Initially I analysed real customers comments. 

## Libraries
- lemmy (the main problem with analysing danish comments is the lack of lemmatizing libraries for danish language, this library that helped me)
- pandas
- numpy
- os
- PIL
- wordcloud
- matplotlib.pyplot
- nltk.stem
- sys
- collections (Counter)
